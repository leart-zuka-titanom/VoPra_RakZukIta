Notebooks and files for the lab course

The Google Colab links for the individual notebooks:

Reduction:

Photometry:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IOEcw8dIWgxtVq_TCtbpdOrPYoOPwj_Q?usp=sharing

Don't forget to copy the notebooks to your own drive if you wish to use the Colab for the notebooks.

# Ok fuck whatever this cunt above me said this is way more important

We were sent the links for our data and for our fits which will of couse be essential.

1. [calibration-data](https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiEV8SkXjjLZffbGXZDcP1/Calibration_files)

2. [M29](https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiBHLUorB3ug3SfodpvnH2/M29)

3. [M39](https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiBtMuxaCu9bwAud1AcoKj/M39)

Since I don't want github to rip my ass apart we're gonna do a lil trickeroo here.

Download the data (if you want to), unzip the files, remove the zip folders and create 3 seperate folders.

Name them 'calibration_files', 'M29' and 'M39'. Put the data with the same name into each folder and everything should be fine.
