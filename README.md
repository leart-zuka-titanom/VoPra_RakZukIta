# What's up cocksuckers let's get it (it's 1 AM)

Basic git repo to just keep our files and python notebooks and everything organized since What's App is fckn trash at doing so 

## How to use git or how to download shit from here

There are two main ways:
- Use git shell on windows since none of y'all be using Linux (download here: [github] https://gitforwindows.org/). Download that shit, open the git shell and type in:\n
'''
git clone 
'''

- Use the Windows Powershell and basically type in the same commands (why not use the Powershell in the first place, funny you ask, well basically cuz it's ass but it's more than enough for what we're gonna be using it I just don't like it)


## How do we add files and shit here

That's a bit more complicated and I will be typing that shit in here at some point but since it's late I'll do that some time else
