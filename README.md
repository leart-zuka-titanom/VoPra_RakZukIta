# What's up cocksuckers let's get it (it's 1 AM)

Basic git repo to just keep our files and python notebooks and everything organized since What's App is fckn trash at doing so 

## How to use git or how to download shit from here

Use the Windows Powershell (it should be installed on your system [just like Uno]) and basically type in:

`git clone https://github.com/leart-zuka-titanom/VoPra_RakZukIta.git`


## How do we add files and shit here

That's a bit more complicated and I will be typing that shit in here at some point but since it's late I'll do that some time else
